# Simple Pytorch Image Classifier

This program consists of a simple CNN that can classify the clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The program include code which makes hyper-parameter tuning very easy. This is done using two special helper functions called RunBuilder and RunManager. All the hyperparameters that need to be tweaked need to be in a dict called "params" and these two helper functions take care of everything else.
